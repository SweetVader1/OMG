# SNAKE GAME
## Context
My project is a snake game in which the user collects apples and the snake gets bigger
## Libraries used:
### PYGAME
Pygame is a "game library", a set of tools that help programmers create games. These include:

Graphics and animation

Sound (including music)

Controls (mouse, keyboard, gamepad and so on)


The random module controls the generation of random numbers.

### GAME IDEA

It's a game variant of a famous "snake game".
The main idea is to collect as more apples as you can, using your snake. 

Use key-controls to control the snake. Beat your records!
